SSAO: We currently have to textures eaching only having one channel GL_RED, where the first is the blured version and the second the unblurred version
	: We could just have one texture with mulitple components GL_RG, for example. Not sure if this is better. --DEAD. Won't work because then how do you
	: blur ? The blur shader binds a texture and then looks all round.

Notes: 
	
	
	
RECAP:
	projection matrix.
	projection divide.
	view matrix.
	slerp
	quats
	transforms

DAY:
	Write pbr notext shader
	Read pbr things
	





TODO:
	HIGH PRIO:
		Sort out shader mayhem !		
		Rewrite EdiableMesh class.
		Figure out how to write to gpu animation data nicely
		Platform window needs abstraction
	
	MED PRIO:
		RenderWorld function needs to go.
				
		Implement array class. Im not sure if it worth it though... (HARRRRD)
		Math lib need formating like opengl.h, const &&& (GARETH)

	LOW PRIO:
		OpenGL layout class
