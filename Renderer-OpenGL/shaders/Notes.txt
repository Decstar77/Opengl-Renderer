SSAO: We currently have to textures eaching only having one channel GL_RED, where the first is the blured version and the second the unblurred version
	: We could just have one texture with mulitple components GL_RG, for example. Not sure if this is better. --DEAD. Won't work because then how do you
	: blur ? The blur shader binds a texture and then looks all round.

Notes: 
	
	
	
RECAP:
	projection matrix.
	projection divide.
	view matrix.
	slerp
	quats
	transforms

DAY:
	Write pbr notext shader
	Read pbr things
	





TODO:
	HIGH PRIO:
		
		We can only write data to a VBO on a single tpye. Eg float, change
		Sort out shader mayhem !
		Mode import options
		Rewrite EdiableMesh class IT HAS AC!!
		Figure out how to write to gpu animation data nicely 
		Math lib need formating like opengl.h
		Imgui docking!
		Need to redo vertex wieght clacl


	MED PRIO:
		RenderWorld function needs to go.
		
		Need to properly abstract the animation process maybe by having a gameobjects.h
		Implement array class. Im not sure if it worth it though...

	LOW PRIO:
		OpenGL layout class
		
		Core dyna array
