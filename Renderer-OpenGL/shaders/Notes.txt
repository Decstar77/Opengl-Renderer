SSAO: We currently have to textures eaching only having one channel GL_RED, where the first is the blured version and the second the unblurred version
	: We could just have one texture with mulitple components GL_RG, for example. Not sure if this is better. --DEAD. Won't work because then how do you
	: blur ? The blur shader binds a texture and then looks all round.

Notes: 
	RenderWorld function needs to go.
	Animation controller is not complete
	Need to properly abstract the animation process maybe by having a gameobjects.h
	We can only write data to a VBO on a single tpye. Eg float, change
	
RECAP:
	projection matrix.
	projection divide.
	view matrix.
	slerp
	quats
	transforms

DAY:
	Write pbr notext shader
	Read pbr things
