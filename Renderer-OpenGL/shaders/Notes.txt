SSAO: We currently have to textures eaching only having one channel GL_RED, where the first is the blured version and the second the unblurred version
	: We could just have one texture with mulitple components GL_RG, for example. Not sure if this is better. --DEAD. Won't work because then how do you
	: blur ? The blur shader binds a texture and then looks all round.

BLOOM:
	There are other options not show on the edit. They are for the guassien blur. The downsample mulitplier and the number of itterations.


Notes: 
	UV Shpere:
			 : This was confusing me. the inverse of atan2(y, x) is x = r*cos(theta), y = r*sin(theta) r > 0
			 : IE: It's sphereical coords

	finish opengl thing
	chapter 2

Performace:
	We do all copies for WorldObject function



TODO:
	HIGH PRIO:
		Sort out shader mayhem !		
		Rewrite EdiableMesh class.
		Figure out how to write to gpu animation data nicely
		Platform window needs abstraction
		Finish bloom editor properties

	MED PRIO:
		RenderWorld function needs to go.
				
		Implement array class. Im not sure if it worth it though... (HARRRRD)
		Math lib need formating like opengl.h, const &&& (GARETH)

	LOW PRIO:
		OpenGL layout class
